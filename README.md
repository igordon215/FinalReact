Introducing Co-Lab, a TCP communications App like Discord built specifically for educational and professional settings. Co-lab streamlines communication through well-organized channels for Group discussions and private messaging. The UI was made leveraging React, JSX, CSS, and JS. To Bring this to life, we implemented a component-based architecture using React hooks for state management. We utilized Axios for streamlined HTTP requests, and creating a centralized API file for organized data fetching. The app's modular structure includes separate components for channels, messages, and UI elements, all powered by custom hooks. We've incorporated a flexible channel creation system, allowing user to easily set up both public and private hooks. This architecture not only meets our current needs but also provides a scalable and maintainable foundation for future enhancements.
